"""numba, imported when the first kernel runs rather than with fastgrib:
`njit`, `intrinsic` and `prange` as the modules use them, standing in
until then. Listing a file, picking fields, reading an index -- the work
that runs no kernel -- then never pays for numba (importing it took 240
of a 640 ms `fastgrib FILE`).

The first call of any kernel imports numba, makes every kernel known so
far (each from its cache as before: the functions are the same), and puts
them in place of their stand-ins in every fastgrib module, so kernels
calling kernels see numba's dispatchers. Kernels defined after that are
numba's from the start, and so is `prange` imported from here. A stand-in
called from Python works throughout.
